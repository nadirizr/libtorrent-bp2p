FAQ
==========================

How to start the various user-interfaces

    Gtk:
        deluge --ui gtk
    Console:
        deluge --ui null
    Web:
        deluge --ui web
        Go to http://localhost:8112/ default-password = "deluge"

I started "deluge" but i don't see the gtk-ui

    The deluge command remembers the last interface it started. Be explicit and type one of the full "deluge -u <interface>" commands listed above.

Why is deluge still listed in my system tray even after I close it ?

    You closed the gtk user-interface but you did not close the daemon. Choose "Quit & Shutdown Daemon" to close both Daemon and gtk-ui.

How do I start the daemon ?

    deluged

How do I start the daemon with logging to console ?

    deluged -d

I can't connect to the daemon from another machine

    * Configure the daemon to allow remote connections
    * Restart the daemon.

    Note: do not do this on a public ip , use the webui for unsecure networks.

I upgraded from 0.5 and plugin x is missing

    1.0 is a rewrite, all old 0.5 plugins have to be rewritten.
